**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Build Pipeline (Iteration 2)  
**Trigger:** Updated requirements documents (FR-008 through FR-013) and development specification questions

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository Setup Script Enhancement

**Issue Addressed:** Script location and branch protection configuration failures

**Changes:**
- **Moved script location:** From `.github/scripts/setup-repository.ps1` to `/setup-repository.ps1` (root level)
- **Enhanced error handling:** Better feedback when GitHub API calls fail
- **Added authentication validation:** Pre-flight checks for GitHub CLI status
- **Implemented dry-run mode:** Test configuration without making changes
- **Added manual fallback instructions:** Detailed guidance when automation fails
- **Improved API integration:** More robust GitHub API calls with proper JSON formatting

**User Impact:** Easier to find and execute, better troubleshooting when setup fails

### 2. Comprehensive Hotfix Process Implementation

**Issue Addressed:** Need for detailed hotfix workflow with mandatory PR validation

**Changes:**
- **Created `hotfix-build.yml` workflow:** Complete GitHub Actions pipeline for hotfixes
- **Implemented PR requirement enforcement:** All hotfixes must go through PR process
- **Added automated validation:** Version validation, build testing, security scanning
- **Implemented auto-merge:** Automatic merge to main after successful release
- **Added release automation:** Automatic GitHub release creation with artifacts
- **Created branch cleanup:** Automatic deletion of hotfix branches after merge

**User Impact:** Clear, automated hotfix process with built-in safety checks

### 3. Detailed Process Documentation

**Issue Addressed:** Need for comprehensive documentation of hotfix and setup processes

**Changes:**
- **Created `HOTFIX-PROCESS.md`:** 200+ line comprehensive hotfix guide
- **Updated `DESIGN.md`:** Enhanced repository setup documentation
- **Updated `PHASE-TRACKING.md`:** Documented iteration 2 changes
- **Added troubleshooting guides:** Common issues and solutions documented

**User Impact:** Clear guidance for all team members on hotfix and setup processes
