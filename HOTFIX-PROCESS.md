# Hotfix Process Design

## Overview

This document details the hotfix process design to address FR-013 and the specific question about hotfix validation and testing workflow.

## Hotfix Workflow Design

The hotfix process ensures that critical bug fixes can be rapidly deployed to production while maintaining code quality and review standards.

### Process Flow

```
Production Issue Identified
         ↓
Release Branch (release/2024-03-15-01)
         ↓
Hotfix Branch (hotfix/2024-03-15-01-security-fix)
         ↓
PR to Release Branch (with validation)
         ↓
Merge to Release Branch
         ↓
Auto-create New Release Branch (release/2024-03-15-02)
         ↓
Release Pipeline (build, test, deploy)
         ↓
Production Deployment
         ↓
PR to Main Branch (for integration)
```

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Hotfix Branch Creation
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from target release branch
git checkout release/2024-03-15-01
git checkout -b hotfix/2024-03-15-01-security-fix
```

**Branch Naming Convention**: `hotfix/{original-release-id}-{hotfix-description}`
- Maintains traceability to original release
- Descriptive naming for easy identification

### 2. Development and Validation
1. **Make hotfix changes** in the hotfix branch
2. **Test locally** to verify fix
3. **Create PR** from hotfix branch to target release branch
4. **PR Validation** runs automatically:
   - Build validation
   - Unit test execution
   - Security scanning
   - Version validation (patch increment)
   - Code quality checks

### 3. Code Review Process
- **Required Reviewers**: At least one reviewer (configurable)
- **Review Criteria**: 
  - Fix addresses the specific issue
  - No unintended side effects
  - Appropriate scope (minimal changes)
  - Proper testing coverage

### 4. Hotfix Integration
After PR approval and merge:
1. **Auto-trigger**: GitHub Action detects merge to release branch
2. **Version Increment**: Automatically increment patch version
3. **New Release Branch**: Create new release branch with incremented version
   - Example: `release/2024-03-15-02` 
4. **Release Pipeline**: Standard release workflow triggers

### 5. Main Branch Integration
Separate process to ensure main branch gets the fix:
1. **Create PR**: From hotfix branch to main branch
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve any conflicts if main has diverged
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure hotfix integrates properly with latest main
4. **Merge**: Complete integration into main branch

## GitHub Actions Implementation

### Hotfix PR Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/hotfix-pr.yml
name: Hotfix PR Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ 'release/*' ]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  validate-hotfix:
    # Same validation as feature PRs
    # Additional checks for hotfix-specific requirements
```

### Hotfix Release Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/hotfix-release.yml
name: Hotfix Release Creation
on:
  push:
    branches: [ 'release/*' ]
  # Triggered when hotfix PR is merged to release branch

jobs:
  create-hotfix-release:
    # Detect if this is a hotfix merge
    # Create new release branch with incremented version
    # Trigger standard release pipeline
```

### Main Branch Integration Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/hotfix-integration.yml
name: Hotfix Main Integration
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      hotfix_branch:
        description: 'Hotfix branch to integrate'
        required: true

jobs:
  integrate-to-main:
    # Create PR from hotfix branch to main
    # Handle conflict detection and notification
```

## Validation and Testing Strategy

### PR-Level Validation
All hotfix PRs must pass:
- ✅ **Build Validation**: Code compiles successfully
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: All existing tests pass
- ✅ **Security Scan**: No new vulnerabilities introduced
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Meets quality standards
- ✅ **Version Check**: Patch version properly incremented

### Release-Level Testing
New hotfix release follows standard promotion:
- ✅ **Development Environment**: Optional quick deployment test
- ✅ **Testing Environment**: Full integration test suite
- ✅ **Staging Environment**: Production-like validation
- ✅ **Production Environment**: Final deployment

### Expedited Process for Critical Issues
For critical security issues or production outages:
- **Skip Optional Environments**: Direct Testing → Production path
- **Parallel Processing**: Run staging tests in parallel with production deployment
- **Emergency Approval**: Override normal approval requirements with justification

## Branch Protection and Rules

### Release Branch Protection
```json
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["hotfix-validation", "build-and-test", "security-scan"]
  },
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 1,
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true,
    "require_code_owner_reviews": true
  }
}
```

### Hotfix Branch Rules
- **Creation**: Must branch from existing release branch
- **Naming**: Must follow `hotfix/{release-id}-{description}` pattern
- **Changes**: Should be minimal and focused on specific issue
- **Testing**: Must include or update tests that verify the fix

## Version Management

### Hotfix Versioning
- **Original Release**: `1.2.3.100` (release/2024-03-15-01)
- **Hotfix Release**: `1.2.3.101` (release/2024-03-15-02)
- **Next Hotfix**: `1.2.3.102` (release/2024-03-15-03)

### Version Increment Rules
```powershell
# Hotfix version increment
if ($branch -match "hotfix/(.+)") {
    $patchVersion = $currentPatch + 1
    $newVersion = "$major.$minor.$patchVersion"
}
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Failed Hotfix Deployment
1. **Immediate**: Rollback to previous release version
2. **Investigation**: Analyze failure in hotfix release
3. **Fix**: Create new hotfix branch addressing the issue
4. **Redeploy**: Follow standard hotfix process

### Hotfix Discovery Issues
1. **Revert**: Create revert PR if hotfix causes new issues
2. **New Hotfix**: Create corrective hotfix following standard process
3. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of issue and resolution plan

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Hotfix Metrics
- **Time to Fix**: From issue identification to production deployment
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of hotfixes successfully deployed without rollback
- **Integration Issues**: Frequency of conflicts during main branch integration

### Alerting
- **Failed Hotfix Builds**: Immediate notification to development team
- **Long-Running Hotfixes**: Alert if hotfix process exceeds expected timeframe
- **Integration Conflicts**: Notification when hotfix conflicts with main branch

## Documentation Requirements

### Per-Hotfix Documentation
- **Issue Description**: Clear description of problem being fixed
- **Root Cause**: Analysis of what caused the issue
- **Fix Description**: Explanation of changes made
- **Testing**: Evidence that fix resolves issue without side effects
- **Deployment Notes**: Special deployment considerations

### Process Documentation
- **Runbook**: Step-by-step instructions for creating hotfixes
- **Escalation**: When and how to escalate hotfix issues
- **Post-Mortem**: Process for analyzing hotfix incidents

This design ensures that hotfixes maintain the same quality standards as regular development while enabling rapid response to production issues.
