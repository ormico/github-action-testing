  - Branch strategy and naming conventions
  - Versioning strategy (4-segment semantic versioning)
  - Build and test strategy
  - Environment deployment strategy
  - Implementation phases (1-4)
  - Risk mitigation strategies
  - Success metrics and technology stack

### Design Phase Analysis Summary

#### Key Design Decisions Made:
1. **Versioning**: 4-segment semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch.Build) for .NET compatibility
2. **Branch Naming**: Date-based release branches (`release/YYYY-MM-DD-increment`)
3. **Preview Versions**: Branch-specific suffixes to avoid collisions (`-preview-{branch-hash}-{increment}`)
4. **Test Strategy**: Unit tests in PR builds, integration/E2E tests in environment deployments
5. **Environment Flow**: Dev (optional) ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Staging (optional) ‚Üí Production
6. **Hotfix Strategy**: Create new release branch from hotfix for clean history

#### Recommended Improvements from Analysis:
1. **Hybrid Version Management**: Manual version increments with automated validation
2. **Granular Test Control**: Reusable test workflows with specific suite execution
3. **Environment Configuration**: Use GitHub Environments for deployment control
4. **Cleanup Automation**: Automated removal of old preview releases and feature branches
5. **Repository Setup**: PowerShell scripts for automated repository configuration

#### Questions Resolved:
- **Test Scope**: Unit tests for PRs, integration tests for environments
- **Version Format**: 4-segment for .NET compatibility with auto-incrementing build numbers
- **Release Creation**: Manual trigger with validation through GitHub Actions
- **Hotfix Process**: Create new release branch for proper versioning and history

## Next Phase: Phase 1 - Core Build Pipeline

### Phase 1 Objectives
Implement the foundational build and test pipeline with version management.

### Phase 1 Deliverables (Ready to Start)
- [ ] **PR Build Workflow** (`pr-build.yml`)
  - Automated builds on PR creation/updates
  - Unit test execution
  - Version increment validation
  - Code quality checks

- [ ] **Feature Build Workflow** (`feature-build.yml`)
  - Manual trigger for feature branch builds
  - Optional preview release creation
  - Docker image building for previews

- [ ] **Version Management System**
  - `version.json` file format and management
  - PowerShell scripts for version operations
  - Automated version validation in PRs

- [ ] **Repository Setup Scripts**
  - PowerShell script for branch protection rules
  - GitHub CLI scripts for repository configuration
  - Environment setup automation

- [ ] **Basic Test Integration**
  - Unit test execution and reporting
  - Test result publishing to GitHub
  - Failure handling and reporting

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] PRs automatically build and run tests
- [ ] Version validation prevents invalid increments
- [ ] Manual feature builds work correctly
- [ ] Preview releases can be created optionally
- [ ] Repository is properly configured with protection rules

### Phase 1 Prerequisites
- Repository with GitHub Actions enabled
- GitHub Container Registry access configured
- PowerShell execution environment
- .NET 8 SDK available in GitHub Actions

## Development Notes

### Current Repository State
- ‚úÖ Simple .NET 8 web application exists (`SimpleWeatherList.Web`)
- ‚úÖ Existing workflow (`main1.yml`) provides Docker build example
- ‚úÖ Application supports container builds with .NET SDK
- ‚úÖ Project structure is clean and ready for CI/CD implementation

### Technology Decisions Confirmed
- **Scripting**: PowerShell (not bash) ‚úÖ
- **Application**: .NET 8 ‚úÖ
- **Containerization**: Docker with .NET SDK container support ‚úÖ
- **Registry**: GitHub Container Registry ‚úÖ
- **Documentation**: Markdown format ‚úÖ

### Architecture Decisions Confirmed
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature/Bug/Release/Hotfix branches ‚úÖ
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning with build numbers ‚úÖ
- **Environment Pipeline**: Dev ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production ‚úÖ
- **Test Strategy**: Unit (PR) ‚Üí Integration (Environment) ‚úÖ

## Ready for Phase 1 Implementation

**Current Status**: Design Phase completed, ready to begin Phase 1 implementation.

**Next Action**: Begin implementing Core Build Pipeline with PR and Feature build workflows.

**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for Phase 1 completion.

**Key Files to Create in Phase 1**:
1. `.github/workflows/pr-build.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/feature-build.yml`
3. `version.json`
4. `.github/scripts/version-management.ps1`
5. `.github/scripts/setup-repository.ps1`
6. Updated branch protection rules and repository configuration
